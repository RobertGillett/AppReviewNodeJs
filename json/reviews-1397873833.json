I rely on this app to start my car to warm up but this app prevents me from doing that. It also gives me misinformation about my car. It tells me my car unlock so when I physically checked the car, the car is actually locked. Not a very reliable app!\n\nUPDATE: 7/20/2021\nGot a response from Mercedes app to contact their customer service about my issue. When I called and spoke to their agent she was clueless. She told me in order for the feature to work I will need to first start my car via the app then turn off the car. Afterwards I will be able to start the car via the app. This defeats the purpose of having that feature in the app. She didn’t know how to fix the problem and wanted to escalate it to the next tier  for help.

I updated the app to their most current version this morning for iOS (iPhone) and yet again, it fails to alert me when the ignition is started on valet protect. This feature is beyond critical to me and I sincerely hope that their IT people are reading the reviews so that they can address this recurrent issue. Come on Mercedes - if you were able to get it right before - you can rectify and get it right again! Please! \n\nJune 10, 2020 - it has now been a whopping 53 days that the app has NOT been able to locate my vehicle. My vehicle has remained in my garage (of which, the garage has WiFi connection indoors). In addition, the engine was turned on today. Yet again, the app FAILED to inform me that IGNITION was turned on (I have valet settings on at ALL times to alert of every single option regarding of car‚Äôs whereabouts and actions). I‚Äôm EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED that this app is SO UNSTABLE and INCONSISTENT!! April 27, 2020 most recent App (4.5.2?): For a while the problems I outlined below - they were inexplicably, and to my great satisfaction, resolved. As of today and after updating the app last evening: the vehicle on the home page is the WRONG COLOR and it NO LONGER shows/states that the model of my car is a CABRIOLET. The app also CANNOT LOCATE MY VEHICLE. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN ENSUING FOR THE LAST 10 DAYS. My car in my garage, but the app for whatever reason ISN‚ÄôT LOCATING IT. KINDLY FIX!! WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON WITH THIS APP?? IT WENT FROM BEING SOMEWHAT UNRELIABLE TO SHOCKINGLY BAD INTO THE ABYSS OF SHARP DECLINE OVER THE PAST TWO MONTHS STRAIGHT WHERE THIS APP IS CURRENTLY RENDERED USELESS!! TO THE DEVELOPERS: YOUR DEFUNCT APP IS CERTAINLY NOT CONVEYING HOW TRULY ‚ÄúSORRY‚Äù YOU ARE FOR THE LITANY OF ‚ÄúINCONVENIENCES‚Äù INCURRED BY ALL OF MB‚Äôs RIGHTFULLY OUTRAGED CLIENTELE!! WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR MB TO FIX ANY, LET ALONE, ALL OF THE PROBLEMS PAINSTAKINGLY OUTLINED IN MY MULTIPLE REVIEWS AND EVERYONE ELSE‚Äôs?!? I LOVE MY CAR, BUT I LOATHE THE TOLL OF ENDLESS STRESS THAT THIS APP IS DOLING OUT. SIMPLY PUT THIS APP IS EGREGIOUS ~ PLEASE FIX IT, WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY!!! Nov 19, 2019 - I downloaded the newest version of this app update. Had high hopes that my below complaints may finally have been addressed, but sadly NO. Valet protection still does NOT FUNCTION!!! MB, what exactly did you fix in the latest version??? REVISION TO MY COMPLAINTS BELOW: A few days ago, Mercedes Me app forced me to login in (despite having the app set to ‚Äúremember‚Äù me and despite there being NO recent app update release since one month ago). ALL of my below COMPLAINTS STILL EXIST. The enumerated EGREGIOUS matters that I‚Äôve been incurring - well, they now have become EXPONENTIALLY WORSE. After logging back in all over again, I was affronted to see that the app RECENTLY WIPED OUT ALL OF MY PERSONAL SETTINGS (which I was compelled to renter) and suddenly the PHOTO (which appears on home screen of app) is now THE WRONG COLOR OF MY VEHICLE!! I wholeheartedly CONCUR with the LITANY of complaints that other reviewers have diligently pointed out - THE APP TAKES FOREVER TO OPEN (that‚Äôs IF it is willing to be responsive) AND NONE OF THE FEATURES FUNCTION ON THIS APP!! I AM FUMINGLY LIVID AT MERCEDES FOR PROVIDING THEIR CUSTOMERS WITH AN UNRELIABLE, UNRESPONSIVE, INACCURATE PIECE OF JUNK APP WHICH FAR EXCEEDS THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE GOING BEYOND THE PAIL OF EXUDING UTTER LACK OF RESPECT TO THEIR CLIENTELE!!! WHY ISN'T MERCEDES‚Äô I.T. DEPT RACING FIX THEIR DEADBEAT APP??? Ever since I downloaded MB‚Äôs most recent app update on my iPhone, the feature (to alert me by text message) whenever my vehicle‚Äôs ignition gets turned on is NO LONGER notifying me. I have repeatedly logged into the app to make sure that this feature is ‚ÄúACTIVATED & ON.‚Äù This feature was working before the last app update. It is critical to me that MB rectifies this problem. PLEASE FIX!! Thank you. **UPDATE ON ABOVE REVIEW (1 DAY LATER): For NO APPARENT REASON, MB‚Äôs app is turning my settings from ON to OFF! Why?!? Even after I have reactivated the setting back to ON the app is still NOT sending me any notification/text message when the IGNITION on my MB is turned on. WHY?!? I have never once altered my personal settings on this app - it is MB‚Äôs APP which is SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CAUSING THIS RECURRENT ERROR/FAILURE!! I will repeat, THIS FEATURE THAT IS TO ALERT ME WHENEVER MY VEHICLE‚ÄôS IGNITION IS TURNED ON IS EXTREMELY CRITICAL TO ME!!

Why is it my 08 Cadillac had remote start built into the key and worked every time, but my 10 year newer Mercedes rarely does? Developers, please work this out! I see the newer Mercedes have a different app, which is likely a sign they are starting from scratch and will abandon this piece of software and thus leave us ‚Äúolder‚Äù car owners in the dust. One star since it works 20% of the time.","voteCount":0,"voteSum":0,"platform":"iOS","appID":"1132286368","appName":"Mercedes me (USA)"},{"id":"5377703960","version":"2.5.2","date":"2020-01-08T19:47:41.000Z","authorName":"367833478","rating":1,"title":"Worst customer service ever","body":"I purchased a 2016 GL450 $90,000 car in 2016.

Mercedes says this is a common problem and may take a few more months, keep calling to check and see if it works yet. Now after 3 months they tell me that even if they get the app to work the car is not capable of remote start. I‚Äôll never buy a Mercedes again.

Not clear, fuzzy at times but the real dog about this Mercedes Benz service is that connecting to a live person often takes what feels like decades. When you finally connect to a live person for personal assistance, most of these with whom you interact with are quite ill equipped to handle anything outside of a very, very general question. They can tell you what day it is or the date per se; but, should you ask anything outside of this, good luck, you'll be transferred for the next 20 years to various other departments! Im only in a trial run and it only took 3 calls for me to come to such a drastic conclusion. It's simply horrible.

VERY disappointed. I‚Äôve deleted and reloaded the 3 times already and it doesn‚Äôt work. Also, after reading other reviews theirs have more options that I was able to experience the two days it actually worked.

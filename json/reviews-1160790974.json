An occasional hiccup when scanning some bar codes however I knew it was because of the barcode being old. I now have an iPhone Xr and the app literally does not work.... AT ALL!\n\nI open the app up and, give permission to access camera, attempt to use bar scanner and will not scan for nothing. I have tried over 20 plus cars and nothing. The part that is frustrating is that I have no other option at this point. No option to enter manually. Either scan the bar code or your just not using the app because there are no setting features. Literally no other option available. \n\nMy phone is up to date as well.
